## Name of project: PlayerSelection (Team Selection Simulator)

## Name of author: Jachin Hugh Dzidumor Kpogli

##  Date created: 19th September, 2025

## Purpose: 
This program allows user input for a single player's name, age, height (in m),
weight(in lbs) and jersey number. It then converts the weight to kg and height to 
cm. It then uses this data to determine their category, position, attacker status, eligibility,
lineup and final decision. Finally, it generates a Player Report based on user input and determined data.

## Java Build tool
VS Code was used in the creation of this project.

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

> If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there.

## Dependency Management
